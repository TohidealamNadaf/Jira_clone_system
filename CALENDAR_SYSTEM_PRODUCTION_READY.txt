WHAT THE SYSTEM DOES:

2. Displays them on an interactive calendar (FullCalendar)
3. Loads status, priority, and issue type filters
4. Allows clicking events to view details
5. Supports drag-and-drop date changes
6. Shows upcoming and overdue issues
7. Filters by project, status, priority, type, assignee
8. Mobile responsive design

DEPLOYMENT STEPS:
1. Clear browser cache: CTRL+SHIFT+DEL → Select all → Clear
2. Hard refresh: CTRL+F5
3. Navigate to: http://localhost:8080/jira_clone_system/public/calendar
4. Open DevTools: F12 → Console
5. Look for: "📅 [CALENDAR] All startup tasks completed"
6. If you see that message, calendar is working ✅

TESTING:
1. Check browser console for "📅 [CALENDAR]" messages
2. Verify calendar displays with events
3. Click an event to see details modal
4. Check Network tab for API requests (F12 → Network → XHR)
5. Verify all API endpoints return valid JSON

TROUBLESHOOTING:
If calendar doesn't load:
- Clear cache and reload (CTRL+F5)
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Check Network tab for failed requests
- Verify user has 'issues.view' permission
- Check database has issues with start_date/end_date

If filters don't populate:
- Look for "Failed to load..." errors in console
- Verify API endpoints return valid JSON
- Check Authorization header (should have Bearer token or session)
- Verify /api/v1/calendar/statuses returns proper format

If events don't appear:
- Verify issues table has start_date and end_date populated
- Check API response in Network tab
- Verify date range is correct
- Check authorization
