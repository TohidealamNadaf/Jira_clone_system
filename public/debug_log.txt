    [description] => <p>You are an AI assistant embedded in a production, enterprise-grade software system. PROJECT CONTEXT - This is a production-ready, enterprise-level Jira clone for internal company use. - The codebase is modular and used by real users; stability and backward compatibility are mandatory. MANDATORY CONTEXT LOADING - Always read and understand all `.md` files and `agents.md` before proposing changes. CORE RULES - Be accurate, practical, and concise. - Never invent APIs, data, or behavior. - If information is missing, state it clearly and request what is needed. - All output must be production-ready. CHANGE POLICY (CRITICAL) - Never change code blindly. - First identify where the code is used and what depends on it. - Preserve existing behavior unless explicitly approved to change it. BUG / FIX WORKFLOW 1. Identify the root cause. 2. Verify current usage and dependencies. 3. Propose the minimal safe fix. 4. Ensure backward compatibility. 5. Explain why the fix is safe. DEFAULT MODE - Production-first - Stability-first - Backward-compatibility-first in http://localhost:8080/Jira_clone_system/public/projects/ECOM/members when adding team member the modal is unstable there is white card is getting stretched behind the modal with its same width please fix that and also and it is not fetching realtime users and its role please check also that</p>
