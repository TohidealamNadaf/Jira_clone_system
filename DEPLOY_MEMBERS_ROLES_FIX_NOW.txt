PROJECT MEMBERS - ROLE DROPDOWN FIX
================================================================================

STATUS: ✅ READY FOR IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT

ISSUE: Role dropdown on /projects/{key}/members only showed "Product Owner"

ROOT CAUSE: getAvailableRoles() query had restrictive WHERE clause

FIX APPLIED:
  File: src/Services/ProjectService.php
  Change: Removed WHERE clause filter, fetch ALL roles
  
  BEFORE: WHERE is_system = 0 OR slug IN ('project-admin', ...)
  AFTER: No WHERE filter - return all roles

  File: views/projects/members.php
  Change: Updated role dropdown to use role name (already correct)

TESTING:
  1. Go to: /projects/CWAYS/members
  2. Click "Add Member" button
  3. Select a user
  4. Click Role dropdown
  5. Should see all roles (Administrator, Developer, Product Owner, etc.)
  6. Select role and submit
  7. Verify member was added with correct role

DEPLOYMENT TIME: 1 minute
TESTING TIME: 2-3 minutes
RISK LEVEL: VERY LOW

FILES MODIFIED:
  - src/Services/ProjectService.php (1 change)
  - views/projects/members.php (2 changes)

BREAKING CHANGES: NONE
DATABASE CHANGES: NONE
DOWNTIME: NO
