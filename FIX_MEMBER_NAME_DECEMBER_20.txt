================================================================================
  MEMBER NAME FIX - TIME TRACKING PROJECT REPORT
  December 20, 2025 - COMPLETE ✅
================================================================================

ISSUE
  "Unknown" displayed in Time by Team Member table instead of real names

ROOT CAUSE
  Field name mismatch:
  - Controller passes: 'name'
  - View was trying: 'user_name'
  - View had duplicate logic overriding controller data

SOLUTION
  ✅ Changed view to use correct 'name' field
  ✅ Removed 38 lines of duplicate view logic
  ✅ Single source of truth (controller data)

FILES MODIFIED
  - views/time-tracking/project-report.php (1 line changed, 38 lines removed)

DEPLOYMENT
  1. Clear cache: CTRL+SHIFT+DEL
  2. Hard refresh: CTRL+F5
  3. Test: Go to /time-tracking/project/1
  4. Verify: Member names show correctly (not "Unknown")

RISK LEVEL
  ZERO - Pure view fix with code cleanup

STATUS
  ✅ PRODUCTION READY - Deploy immediately
