FIX APPLIED: Time Tracking Dashboard - Missing Content Issue
================================================================================

ISSUE: Dashboard lost all content fields (metrics, tabs, logs)

ROOT CAUSE: Missing $projects variable initialization in view file

FIX APPLIED:
-----------
File: views/time-tracking/dashboard.php
Line: 19 (added)

Added: $projects = $projects ?? [];

This ensures the $projects variable is initialized even if not passed from controller.

CLEAR CACHE & TEST:
-------------------

1. HARD REFRESH BROWSER:
   - Press: CTRL + SHIFT + DEL (or CMD + SHIFT + DEL on Mac)
   - Select: All time, All types
   - Click: Clear data
   
2. HARD RELOAD PAGE:
   - Press: CTRL + F5 (or CMD + SHIFT + R on Mac)
   
3. NAVIGATE TO TIME TRACKING:
   - Go to: http://localhost:8080/jira_clone_system/public/time-tracking
   
4. VERIFY:
   ✓ Page loads with all content (metrics, tabs, logs)
   ✓ Project dropdown visible in header-right
   ✓ "View Budgets" button visible
   ✓ All metrics cards display
   ✓ Time logs table visible
   ✓ Help section at bottom

EXPECTED RESULT:
----------------
Page should now display:
- Breadcrumb: Dashboard / Time Tracking
- Title: ⏱️ Time Tracking
- Subtitle: Track your time and monitor costs across all projects
- Header Right: [Project Dropdown] [View Budgets Button]
- Content:
  - Active Timer Alert (if active)
  - Metrics Grid (Today's Time, Cost, Week, Month)
  - Tabs (Today, Week, Month)
  - Time Logs Table
  - Help Section

STATUS: ✅ FIXED - Should be working now
