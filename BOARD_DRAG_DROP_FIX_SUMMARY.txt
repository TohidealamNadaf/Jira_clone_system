BOARD DRAG & DROP FIX - SUMMARY
================================================================================

ISSUE REPORTED:
  Board drag and drop is not happening.

ROOT CAUSE:
  JavaScript event listeners were not properly initializing because:
  1. Event listeners attached before DOM elements fully loaded
  2. No error handling if elements not found
  3. No debugging info to diagnose issues
  4. No retry logic for timing issues

SOLUTION APPLIED:
  Enhanced views/projects/board.php with:
  1. Smart initialization that waits for DOM to be ready
  2. Element detection before attaching listeners
  3. Retry logic (500ms intervals) if elements not found
  4. Comprehensive console logging for debugging
  5. Status count updates after successful transition
  6. Better error handling and recovery

FILES MODIFIED:
  - views/projects/board.php (improved JavaScript)

NEW FEATURES ADDED:
  - Console logging with emoji indicators
  - Retry mechanism for initialization
  - Status badge updates
  - Better error messages

TESTING:
  Quick Test (5 minutes):

  5. Reload page to verify persistence
