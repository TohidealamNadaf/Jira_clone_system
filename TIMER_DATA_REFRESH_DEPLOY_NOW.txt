TIMER DATA NOT REFLECTING AFTER STOP - FIX & DEPLOY
================================================================================

ISSUE:
  When you stop the timer, it saves to database but page doesn't update.
  User sees old data without the new time log entry.
  
STATUS: ✅ FIXED
SEVERITY: Medium (UX Issue)
TIME TO DEPLOY: 3 minutes

WHAT WAS FIXED:
  Added automatic page reload 2 seconds after timer stops
  Now users see updated time logs immediately
  No more need to manually refresh the page

FILE CHANGED:
  - public/assets/js/floating-timer.js (8 lines added)

DEPLOYMENT STEPS:

  Step 1: Verify the fix is in place
    Open: public/assets/js/floating-timer.js
    Search for: "Refreshing page to show updated time logs"
    Should find around line 417
    
  Step 2: Clear browser cache
    Ctrl+Shift+Del → Select all → Clear all cookies & cache
    
  Step 3: Test the fix
    1. Go to: http://localhost:8081/jira_clone_system/public/time-tracking/project/1
    2. Start Timer
    3. Wait 5 seconds
    4. Click "Stop Timer"
    5. Enter description (or leave blank)
    6. Expected:
       ✓ Success notification appears
       ✓ After 2 seconds, page auto-refreshes
       ✓ New time log appears in tables
       ✓ User sees "Time by Team Member" updated
       ✓ User sees "Time by Issue" updated
    
  Step 4: Verify
    ✓ No console errors (F12 → Console)
    ✓ Notification shown before refresh
    ✓ Page reloads automatically
    ✓ New data appears in all tables

EXPECTED RESULT:
  ✓ Stop timer
  ✓ See success notification
  ✓ Auto-refresh in 2 seconds
  ✓ See updated time logs
  ✓ Data reflects immediately (no manual refresh needed)

ROLLBACK (if needed):
  git checkout public/assets/js/floating-timer.js
  Clear browser cache
  Hard refresh: Ctrl+F5

NO DATABASE MIGRATIONS NEEDED
NO PHP/BACKEND CHANGES NEEDED
NO CONFIG CHANGES NEEDED
ONLY JAVASCRIPT MODIFICATION

ESTIMATED DEPLOYMENT TIME: 3 minutes

TECHNICAL NOTES:
  - JavaScript reload after 2 second delay
  - Gives user time to read success notification
  - Fresh data fetched from database on reload
  - Simple and reliable approach
  - No complex AJAX or API changes
