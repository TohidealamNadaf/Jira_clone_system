  QUICK DEPLOYMENT CARD: Create Issue Modal - Projects Loading Fix
================================================================================

ISSUE FIXED
-----------
Projects dropdown was empty in Create Issue modal - no data being loaded

ROOT CAUSE
----------
1. JS file had PHP template tags (<?= ?>) that weren't being processed
2. loadModalData() function was never called in initialization

SOLUTION APPLIED
----------------
✅ Added inline initialization code to views/layouts/app.php
✅ Updated all API URLs in create-issue-modal.js to use dynamic paths
✅ Added loadModalData() to initialization sequence
✅ Removed PHP template tags from static JS file

FILES MODIFIED
--------------
1. views/layouts/app.php (Lines 2082-2154)
   - Added inline project/user loading script with PHP URL generation
   
2. public/assets/js/create-issue-modal.js
   - Line 355: Added loadModalData() call
   - All API URLs now use window.APP_BASE_PATH
   - Updated 5 functions to use dynamic URL construction

DEPLOYMENT STEPS
----------------
1. Clear browser cache:
   Windows: CTRL + SHIFT + DEL → Select all → Clear

2. Hard refresh browser:
   CTRL + F5

3. Test:
   - Go to: http://localhost:8081/jira_clone_system/public/dashboard
   - Click: "+ Create" button in navbar
   - Verify: Projects dropdown should show list of projects

4. Check DevTools Console (F12):
   Should see:
   ✅ Create Issue Modal initialized, loading data...
   ✅ Projects loaded: [...]
   ✅ Users loaded: [...]

EXPECTED RESULTS
----------------
✅ Modal opens when clicking Create
✅ Projects dropdown populated
✅ Assignee dropdown populated
✅ Issue types load when project selected
✅ Priorities load
✅ Form submission works
✅ No JavaScript errors

ROLLBACK (if needed)
-------------------
Files are easily reversible - only added/modified JavaScript initialization

STATUS
------
✅ READY FOR IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT
✅ LOW RISK (initialization code only, no database changes)
✅ NO DOWNTIME REQUIRED

NEXT STEPS
----------
1. Deploy changes to production
2. Test in all browsers
3. Monitor console for errors
4. Team can start using Create modal for issue creation
