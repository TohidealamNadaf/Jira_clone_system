## Decision Points for Management

### 1. Deployment Timing
**Decision**: Deploy this week or wait 2 weeks?  
**Recommendation**: Deploy this week (all systems ready)  
**Risk**: Low - system is well-tested

### 2. Email Delivery
**Decision**: Deploy with or without email?  
**Recommendation**: Deploy without email, add in Week 1  
**Impact**: In-app notifications will still work

### 3. Team Training
**Decision**: Training before or after deployment?  
**Recommendation**: Training before (same day)  
**Duration**: 2-3 hours

### 4. Staged vs Immediate
**Decision**: 2-week staged or immediate?  
**Recommendation**: Immediate (system ready)  
**Risk Mitigation**: Full backup + rollback plan
