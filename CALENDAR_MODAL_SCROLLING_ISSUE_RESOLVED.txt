CALENDAR MODAL SCROLLING - ISSUE RESOLVED
Date: December 24, 2025
Status: ✅ FIXED & PRODUCTION READY
================================================================================

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
  User reported that when clicking on calendar events, the modal would open
  but the content could not be scrolled. Users were unable to see all issue
  details (Story Points, Labels, Description, Timeline, etc.) without closing
  the modal.

SCREENSHOT EVIDENCE:
  - Modal opened for ECOM-9 "Fix responsive design on mobile"
  - All visible content shown but no scrollbar
  - Users could not access full event details

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
  The HTML file views/calendar/index.php contained DUPLICATE modal body HTML:
  
  ✓ Lines 233-371: Proper modal structure with .modal-body-scroll
  ✗ Lines 372-499: Duplicate orphaned <div class="modal-body"> (128 lines)
  
  The duplicate was breaking the modal's flexbox layout, preventing scrolling
  even though the CSS for .modal-body-scroll was correct and in place.

THE FIX:
  ✅ Removed 128 lines of duplicate HTML from views/calendar/index.php
  ✅ Kept the properly structured modal (lines 233-371)
  ✅ Modal now has single, clean body with correct scrolling CSS
  ✅ Flex layout now works as designed

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
  File Modified: views/calendar/index.php
  Lines Removed: 372-499 (orphaned duplicate HTML)
  Changes: HTML structure only (no JavaScript/CSS/API changes)
  Risk Level: VERY LOW

CSS LAYOUT (Correct after fix):
  .modal-content {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
      height: 80vh;
  }
  
  .modal-body-scroll {
      flex: 1;                         /* Takes available space */
      overflow-y: auto;               /* Enables scrolling */
      max-height: calc(80vh - 140px); /* Viewport limit */
  }

WHAT USERS WILL SEE:
  BEFORE: Modal opens → content cut off → no scroll → frustration
  AFTER:  Modal opens → scrollbar appears → full content visible → smooth UX
