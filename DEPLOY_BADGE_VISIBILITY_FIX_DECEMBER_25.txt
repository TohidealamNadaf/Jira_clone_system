BADGE TEXT VISIBILITY FIX - COMPLETE DEPLOYMENT CARD
================================================================================

STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE - All 22 instances fixed across 10 files

ISSUE FIXED:
- Status badge text was invisible on dark backgrounds (e.g., "In Progress" 
  with dark plum color #8B1956)
- Affected badges on project pages, workflows, issues, backlog, dashboard, 
  search, reports, and sidebars

SOLUTION APPLIED:
- Added `color: white !important;` to all status badges system-wide
- Changed workflow status badges from light/transparent to solid colors
- Ensured proper contrast for WCAG AAA compliance
