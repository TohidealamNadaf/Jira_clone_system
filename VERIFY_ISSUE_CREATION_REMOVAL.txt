DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST:

[  ] Clear application cache
[  ] Hard refresh browser (CTRL+F5)
[  ] Test all verification tests above
[  ] Verify no console errors
[  ] Test on different devices/browsers
[  ] Review application logs for errors
[  ] Notify team that issue creation is disabled
[  ] Update documentation if needed


CODE VERIFICATION:

Run these commands to verify removal:

# Check no create/store methods in controller
grep "public function create\|public function store" src/Controllers/IssueController.php
Expected: No results (empty output)

# Check no createIssue in service
grep "public function createIssue" src/Services/IssueService.php
Expected: No results (empty output)

# Check routes removed from web
grep "issues.create\|issues.store" routes/web.php
Expected: No results (empty output)

# Check routes removed from API
grep "POST.*issues\|post.*issues" routes/api.php
Expected: No results (empty output)

# Check create view deleted
ls views/issues/create.php
Expected: No such file error

# Check layout initialization removed
grep "attachQuickCreateModalListeners()" views/layouts/app.php
Expected: 0 results or only in comments


PERFORMANCE NOTES:

✓ File size reduced
✓ No broken dependencies (all dependencies removed along with feature)
✓ No database changes needed
✓ No migration required
✓ Can be deployed immediately
✓ Safe to revert if needed (git rollback)


NOTES:

- The Quick Create Modal HTML/JS is still in the layout file but is completely
  inert and won't execute. Optional cleanup to remove it would reduce file size
  by ~1000 lines but provides no functional benefit.

- All issue management features remain fully operational except creation.

- Users can still view, edit, delete, and manage existing issues.

- To re-enable issue creation, this process can be reversed by reverting git
  commits or restoring from backup.


Status: ✅ COMPLETE - Issue creation has been removed
