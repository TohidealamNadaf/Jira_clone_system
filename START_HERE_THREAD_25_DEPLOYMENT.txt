================================================================================
WHAT YOU'RE DEPLOYING

================================================================================
CHOOSE YOUR PATH
================================================================================

PATH A: FAST (5 minutes total)
  → Just clear cache, hard refresh, quick test
  → Best for: Confident teams, small deployments
  → Risk: Very low
  → Read: THREAD_25_QUICK_ACTION_CARD.txt
  → Then: Follow the 5-step procedure

PATH B: THOROUGH (45-50 minutes total)
  → Complete deployment guide with full testing
  → Best for: Cautious teams, production environments
  → Risk: Very low  
  → Read: THREAD_25_PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_FINAL_CHECKLIST.md
  → Then: Follow the 8-step procedure

PATH C: REFERENCE (15 minutes)
  → Just want overview and key info
  → Best for: Managers, quick reviews
  → Read: This file (START_HERE_THREAD_25_DEPLOYMENT.txt)
  → Then: Decide if deployment ready

================= = ====================================================
MOST IMPORTANT STEP: CLEAR CACHE
================================================================================

This is CRITICAL. Without cache clear, you'll see old design.

Browser Cache:
  1. Press CTRL+SHIFT+DEL (Command+Shift+Delete on Mac)
  2. Select "All time" or "Everything"
  3. Check all boxes (Cookies, Cache, etc.)
  4. Click "Clear data" or "Clear"

Hard Refresh:
  1. Press CTRL+F5 (or Command+Shift+R on Mac)
  2. If prompted, click "Clear cache and reload"
  3. Wait for page to fully reload

Application Cache:
  1. Open terminal/command line
  2. cd c:\laragon\www\jira_clone_system
  3. Run: rm -rf storage/cache/*
     (Windows PowerShell: Remove-Item -Path "storage/cache" -Recurse -Force)

DO THIS FIRST before testing anything.

================================================================================
WHICH OPTION FOR YOU?
================================================================================

Choose Path A if:
  ✓ You understand CSS/HTML changes
  ✓ You've done this before
  ✓ You trust the testing already done
  ✓ You need to deploy quickly
  ✓ You're experienced with systems

Choose Path B if:
  ✓ You're responsible for production
  ✓ You want comprehensive verification
  ✓ You need documented proof of testing
  ✓ You have stakeholders to report to
  ✓ You prefer being thorough

Choose Path C if:
  ✓ You're reviewing before decision
  ✓ You're assigning work to others
  ✓ You just need overview
  ✓ You want quick summary

Most teams choose PATH B for production.

================================================================================

================================================================================
IF SOMETHING LOOKS WRONG
================================================================================

Step 1: Clear Cache Again
  → CTRL+SHIFT+DEL, select all, clear
  → CTRL+F5 hard refresh
  → Wait for full reload

Step 2: Try Different Browser
  → Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
  → Does it work in another browser?
  → If yes, clear your browser cache more
  → If no, continue below

Step 3: Check Console (F12)
  → Press F12 to open Developer Tools
  → Go to Console tab
  → Are there any red error messages?
  → Screenshot the error if present

Step 4: Read Documentation
  → THREAD_25_PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_FINAL_CHECKLIST.md
  → DEPLOY_WORKFLOWS_REDESIGN_NOW_DECEMBER_25.txt
  → DEPLOY_BADGE_VISIBILITY_FIX_DECEMBER_25.txt

Step 5: Rollback (< 5 minutes)
  → Restore original files from backup
  → Clear cache: CTRL+SHIFT+DEL
  → Hard refresh: CTRL+F5
  → Previous design returns
  → No harm done

Important: We've tested this thoroughly. The design is solid.
