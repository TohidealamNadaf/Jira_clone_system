TIMER RESUME BUG FIX - DEPLOY NOW
================================================================================

ISSUE:
  Error when resuming a paused timer: "No paused timer found for this user"

SEVERITY: High (Blocks timer resume feature)
STATUS: ✅ FIXED
TIME: 5 minutes to deploy

WHAT WAS FIXED:
  1. Updated TimeTrackingService::resumeTimer() to use active_timers table
  2. Changed from inefficient search query to direct lookup
  3. Added proper status validation before resuming

FILES CHANGED:
  - src/Services/TimeTrackingService.php (8 lines modified)

DEPLOYMENT STEPS:

  Step 1: Verify the fix is in place
    Open: src/Services/TimeTrackingService.php
    Line 160-180: Should show the NEW method using getActiveTimer()
    
  Step 2: Clear browser cache
    Ctrl+Shift+Del → Clear all cookies & cache → Reload page
    
  Step 3: Test the fix
    1. Go to: http://localhost:8081/jira_clone_system/public/time-tracking/project/1
    2. Start Timer
    3. Wait 5 seconds
    4. Click "Pause" (should work)
    5. Click "Resume" (should work, no error)
    
  Step 4: Verify in production
    Restart Apache in XAMPP Control Panel
    Test again at same URL

EXPECTED RESULT:
  ✓ Pause works
  ✓ Resume works (no error)
  ✓ Timer continues from paused time
  ✓ Cost continues calculating

ROLLBACK (if needed):
  git checkout src/Services/TimeTrackingService.php
  Restart Apache

NO DATABASE MIGRATIONS NEEDED
NO CONFIG CHANGES NEEDED
NO CACHE CLEAR NEEDED

ESTIMATED DEPLOYMENT TIME: 5 minutes
